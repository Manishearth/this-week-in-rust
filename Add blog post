# Quote of the Week

> I used to think of programs as execution flowing and think about what the CPU is doing. As I moved to rust I started thinking a lot more about memory: how the data was laid out in memory, and how ownership of different parts of memory is given to different parts of the program at run time.

[Oliver Gould on "The Open Source Show: All About Rust](https://youtu.be/FYGS2q1bljE?t=280)
