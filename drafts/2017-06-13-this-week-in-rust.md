## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: merge] [Conversions from `&mut T` to `&Cell<T>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1789).
* [disposition: merge] [Match ergonomics using default binding modes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2005).
* [disposition: merge] [Tiered browser support policy for Rust's web content](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1985).
* [disposition: merge] [Prepare global allocators for stabilization](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1974).

## New RFCs

* [Implement Add for OsString](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2020).
* [Allow comparisons between integers of different types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2021).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Combining opening and closing delims](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)

# Quote of the Week

> Nothing to worry about, if you ask me. There's no official "Rust ideology".
>
> All you have to do is to accept the message of memory safety and swear allegiance to Our Lord and Savior, Rust programming language, protector of the highly parallel and the most efficient. Avoid the sin of unsafety, respect the lifetimes, mark your path with Send and Sync, and you too can become a member of Rust Evangelism Strike Force.
