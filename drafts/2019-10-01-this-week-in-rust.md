# Quote of the Week

> I don’t like Rust being pigeon holed as a “safer C++”—it’s so much more than that.
>
> It’s been stated more often lately. It overlooks the fact that Rust has actively opened the door to systems programming to people coming from langs like Javascript, where C and C++ never did.
