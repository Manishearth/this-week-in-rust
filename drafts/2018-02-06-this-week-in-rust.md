# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [rust-semverver](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-semverver), an as-of-yet buggy, but already useful semantic versioning (semver) checking tool. Thanks to [Philipp Hansch](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/phansch) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
