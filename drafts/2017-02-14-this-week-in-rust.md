## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1828: Rust bookshelf](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1828). Create a "Rust Bookshelf" of learning resources for Rust.

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Allow coercing non-capturing closures to function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1558).
* [disposition: close] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).
* [disposition: close] [Warn by default when encountering a statement which only consists of an equality comparison](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1812).
* [Allow uncallable method impls to be omitted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1699).

## Closed RFCs

Following proposals were rejected by [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) after their 'final comment period' elapsed.

* [Variant types and untagged enums](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1450).

## New RFCs

* [Allow use of pipe operator in patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1882).
* [Move metadata into import libraries for MSVC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1883).
* [Add unstable sort to libcore](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1884).
* [Add explicit proper tail calls to Rust via the `become` keyword](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1888).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/56)
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/55)
* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)

Ready for PR:

There's [a lot of them](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready-for-PR) right now, contributions here would be very welcome. If you want advice or help getting started, please ping nrc, or any other member of the style team, in #rust-style.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).

Other significant issues:

* [types](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/15)
* [closures](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/35)
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
* [`extern` vs `extern "C"`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/52)

# Friends of the Forest

Our community likes to recognize people who have made outstanding contributions
to the Rust Project, its ecosystem, and its community. These people are
'friends of the forest'.

This week's friends of the forest are:

* From [jer]:

> I'd like to nominate [colin_kiegel] and [florob]. Both are co-organizers at the monthly [rust.cologne] meetup, keeping it running all the time.

[jer]: https://github.com/badboy
[colin_kiegel]: https://users.rust-lang.org/users/colin_kiegel/activity
[florob]: https://users.rust-lang.org/users/florob/activity
[rust.cologne]: http://rust.cologne/

* From [brson]:

> A few months ago [Yamakaky] pinged me and offered to help maintain [error-chain]. I eagerly dumped all maintenence duties on them, and since then they have made the code more elegant, dealt with all issue and pull request triage, and made the releases. If you've appreciated error-chain lately, appreciate @Yamakaky, Friend of the Forest. Thanks, @Yamakaky!

# Quote of the Week

> Back in these days, we had none of this newfangled “stability” business. The compiler broke your code every two weeks. Of course, you wouldn’t know that because the compiler would usually crash before it could tell you that your code was broken! Sigils roamed the lands freely, and cargo was but a newborn child which was destined to eventually end the tyranny of Makefiles.
