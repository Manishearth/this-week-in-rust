## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1733: Trait alias](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1733).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).
* [disposition: close] [Check future-proofing of `macro_rules!` using FIRST sets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1746).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [Proposal for default crate recommendation ranking](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1824).
* [disposition: merge] [Remove static bound from type_id](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1849).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: merge] [Improve the `assert_eq` failure message formatting to increase legibility](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1866).
* [disposition: merge] [A portability lint](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1868).
* [disposition: postpone] [Add `SafeDeref` and `SafeDerefMut`, equivalent to `Deref` and `DerefMut` but which are guaranteed to always return the same object](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1873).
* [disposition: postpone] [Unsafe lifetime](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1918). Add a new special lifetime, `'unsafe`, that implicitly satisfies any constraint, but may only be instantiated within an unsafe context.

## New RFCs

* [Make RangeInclusive just a two-field struct (amend 1192)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1980).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Add text from the structs/unions RFC to the guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/78).
* [Ordering of types of groups within a module](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/71).
* [Convention about empty lines](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/57).
* [Imports (`use`)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/24)
* [Closures](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/35)
* [Where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)

# Quote of the Week

> There are many ways in which Rust is like a version of C/C++ that mutated when Haskell was injected into its veins.
