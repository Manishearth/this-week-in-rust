# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [Crate evaluation for 2017-05-16: log](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/crate-evaluation-for-2017-05-16-log/5185). People are needed to help fill out the log crate evaluation, write cookbook recipes for the log crate, and generally offer their opinions.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: close] [Allow any Displayable type for expect](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1968).
* [disposition: merge] [Expand and stabilize `impl Trait`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1951).
* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [Remove static bound from type_id](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1849).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).

## New RFCs

* [`Result::pass()`, turning `Result<T,E>` into `Result<U,F>`, if `From` is set up](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1996).
* [Opaque Data structs for FFI](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1993).
* [Add external doc attribute to rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1990).
* [Match branch semicolon](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1994).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Spaces around `=` in attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/82)
* [Return type on new line](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/77) - proposed to close
* [Single-line where](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/74) - proposed to close
* [Attribute/doc comment ordering](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/72)
* [Ordering of types of groups within a module](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/71)
* [Function calls](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/65) and [chains of calls](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/66)
* [Combining opening and closing delims](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)
* [Where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved
