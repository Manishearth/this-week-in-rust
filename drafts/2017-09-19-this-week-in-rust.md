## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a

## New RFCs

* [Add support to Cargo for alternative registries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2141).

* [Add match/in statements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2144).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

We're currently writing up the discussions, we'd love some help. Check out [the tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/89) for details.

# Quote of the Week

>> When programmers are saying that there are a lot of bicycles in code that means that it contains reimplementations of freely available libraries instead of using them
>
> Presumably the metric for this would be bicyclomatic complexity?
