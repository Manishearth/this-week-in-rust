# Quote of the Week

> It‚Äôs like building stuff with LEGO. Sure, it could be a single type, but then you‚Äôd need a type for every possible combination of types, which would arguably be a whole lot worse.

‚Äì Daniel Keep [on rust-users](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/help-getting-started-with-converting-c-project/22370/8)

Thanks to llogiq for the suggestion!
