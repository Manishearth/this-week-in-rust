# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [async-trait](https://github.com/dtolnay/async-trait), a procedural macro to allow `async fn`s in trait methods.
Thanks to [Ehsan M. Kermani](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/592) for the suggestion!

# Quote of the Week

> Rust clearly popularized the ownership model, with similar implementations being considered in D, Swift and other languages. This is great news for both performance and memory safety in general.
>
> Also let's not forget that Rust is not the endgame. Someone may at one point find or invent a language that will offer an even better position in the safety-performance-ergonomics space. We should be careful not to get too attached to Rust, lest we stand in progress' way.
