# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-nono](https://github.com/hobofan/cargo-nono), a cargo subcommand to check a crate's dependencies for no-std compatibility. Thanks to [Hobofan](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9wbv0v/cargo_nono_detect_possible_no_std_compatibility) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Quote of the Week

> I’m also pretty sure that most languages would not go that far. The idea that the type plugged in has only one possible value, therefore it doesn’t need to be stored and methods on that don’t care about the `self` reference is pretty neat.

– Michael 'vorner' Vaner [on his blog](https://vorner.github.io/2018/11/11/truly-zero-cost.html)

Thanks to llogiq for the suggestion!
