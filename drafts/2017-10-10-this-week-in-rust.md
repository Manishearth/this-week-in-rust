## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2094: Non-lexical lifetimes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2094).
* [RFC 2137: Support defining C-compatible variadic functions in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2137).
* [RFC 2141: Add support to Cargo for alternative registries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2141).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Fallible collection allocation 1.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2116).
* [disposition: merge] [Implicit caller location (third try to the unwrap/expect line info problem)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2091).
* [disposition: merge] [Unsized rvalues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1909).

## New RFCs

* [impl-only-use](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2166). The `use …::{… as …}` syntax can now accept `_` as alias to a trait to only import the implementations of such a trait.
