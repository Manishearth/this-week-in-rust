# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [safety-guard](https://gitlab.com/tdiekmann/safety-guard), a crate providing a `#[safety]` attribute that generates both a doc entry and debug assertion. Thanks to [Willi Kappler](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/506) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Quote of the Week

> all the ergonomic improvements in rust 2018 are really messing up my book that consists entirely of running face-first into compiler errors so i can explain concepts.
