## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2008: Future-proofing enums/structs with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2008).
* [RFC 1925: Allow an optional vert at the beginning of a match branch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1925).
* [RFC 2025: Enable nested method calls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2025).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Add external doc attribute to rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1990).
* [disposition: merge] [Clamp function for primitive types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1961).
* [disposition: merge] [Generic associated types (associated type constructors)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598).
* [disposition: merge] [Evolving Rust through checkpoints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2052).
* [disposition: merge] [Allow Irrefutable Patterns in if-let and while-let statements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2086).

## New RFCs

* [Clarify and streamline paths and visibility](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2126).
* [Provide a community-wide banner server](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2127).
* [Nested groups in imports](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2128).
* [Crate changelogs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2129). Add changelog support to `cargo` and [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
* [Copy/Clone closures](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2132). Implement `Clone` and `Copy` for closures where possible.
* [Compiler-generated Clone impls for arrays and tuples](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2133).
* [Add `Option::filter` to the standard library](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2124).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

We're currently writing up the discussions, we'd love some help. Check out [the tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/89) for details.

# Quote of the Week

> Abomonation has no safe methods. […] If you are concerned about safety, it may be best to avoid Abomonation all together. It does several things that may be undefined behavior, depending on how undefined behavior is defined.

— [Frank McSherry in Abomination docs](http://www.frankmcsherry.org/abomonation/abomonation/trait.Abomonation.html).
