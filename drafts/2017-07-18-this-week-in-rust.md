# Friends of the Forest

Our community likes to recognize people who have made outstanding contributions
to the Rust Project, its ecosystem, and its community. These people are
'friends of the forest'.

Our this week's friend of the forest is [Guillaume Gomez](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez), whose [influence is evident everywhere you look in Rust](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-friends-of-the-forest/7295/23).

# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [extfsm](https://crates.io/crates/extfsm), a crate to help build finite state machines. Thanks to [Tony P.](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/prz) for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2033: Experimentally add coroutines to Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Tweak object safety rules to allow static dispatch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2027).
* [disposition: merge] [Allow the usage of `use` inside `impl` blocks and `match` blocks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1976).
* [disposition: postpone] [Warn by default when casting a pointer to an integer smaller than usize](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1782).
* [disposition: merge] [Amend #1440: allow `const` items to contain drop types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1817).
* [disposition: merge] [Add `extern type` declarations for declaring types from external libraries which have an unknown size/layout](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1861).
* [disposition: merge] [Prepublication dependencies for Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1969).
* [disposition: merge] [Support the `#[must_use]` attribute on arbitrary functions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1940).
* [disposition: merge] [Allow the `?` operator to be used in `main`, and in `#[test]` functions and doctests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1937).

## New RFCs

* [Make unreachable patterns error, not warning](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2058).
* [Move "How do we teach this?" before "Detailed design"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2059).
* [Allow destructuring of structs that implement Drop](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2061).
* [Add replace and swap functions to RefCell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2057).
* [Allow trivial constraints to appear in where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2056).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

An interesting issue:

* [Define short](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/47)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [paths](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/69)
* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)
* [control flow](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/62)

# Quote of the Week

> Unsafe is your friend! It's maybe not a friend like you would invite to your sister's wedding, or the christening of her first-born child. But it's sort of the friend who lives in the country and has a pick-up truck and 37 guns. And so you might not want to hang out with them all the time, but if you need something blown up he is there for you.

— [Simon Heath on game development in Rust (at 38:35 in video)](https://air.mozilla.org/game-developement-in-rust/).
