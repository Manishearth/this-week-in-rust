## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: postpone] [Introduce `with` bounds for pi types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1932).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: merge] [Remove static bound from type_id](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1849).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).

## New RFCs

* [Allow any Displayable type for expect](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1968).
* [Prepublication dependencies for Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1969).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Imports (`use`)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/24)
* [Closures](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/35)
* [Where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)

# Quote of the Week

>  Nobody expects the Rust Evangelism Strike Force!
> Our chief weapon is surprise, surprise and fearless concurrency... fearless concurrency and surprise... our two weapons are fearless concurrency and surprise, and ruthless efficiency our three, weapons are fearless concurrency, and surprise, and ruthless efficiency, and an almost fanatical devotion to zero-cost abstractions. Our four, no--amongst our weapons... Amongst our weaponry... are, such elements as fearless concurrency, surprise... I'll come in again.
