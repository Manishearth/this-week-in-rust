# Quote of the Week

> In theory it would be entirely reasonable to guess that most Rust projects would need to use a significant amount of unsafe code to escape the
> limitations of the borrow checker. However, in practice it turns out (shockingly!) that the overwhelming majority of programs can be implemented
> perfectly well using only safe Rust.
