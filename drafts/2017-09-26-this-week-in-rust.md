# Updates from Rust Community

## News & Blog Posts
- [Password Manager In Rust Using Argon2](http://vitiral.github.io/2017/09/12/password-manager-in-rust-using-argon2.html): how writing my second (rust) CLI
  was fun and easy.

# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [rug](https://crates.io/crates/rug), a crate providing arbitrary-precision integers, rationals and floating-point numbers, using GMP, MPFR and MPC.
Thank you, [Trevor Spiteri](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/tspiteri) for the suggestion!

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Non-lexical lifetimes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2094).

* [disposition: postpone] [`'fn` lifetime ascription](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1847). Add a `'fn` lifetime that is bound to the scope of the body of the current innermost function or closure.
* [disposition: postpone] [Tuple-based variadic generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1935).

## New RFCs

* [Raw identifiers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2151). Add a raw identifier format `r#ident`, so crates written in future language epochs/versions can still use an older API that overlaps with new keywords.

* [Debuginfo-based panic locations](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2154).

# Quote of the Week

> <heycam\> one of the best parts about stylo has been how much easier it has been to implement these style system optimizations that we need, because Rust
> <heycam\> can you imagine if we needed to implement this all in C++ in the timeframe we have
> <bholley\> heycam: yeah srsly
> <bholley\> heycam: it's so rare that we get fuzz bugs in rust code
> <bholley\> heycam: considering all the complex stuff we're doing
> * heycam remembers getting a bunch of fuzzer bugs from all kinds of style system stuff in gecko
> <bholley\> heycam: think about how much time we could save if each one of those annoying compiler errors today was swapped for a fuzz bug tomorrow :-)
> <njn\> you guys sound like an ad for Rust
