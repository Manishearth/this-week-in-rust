# Quote of the Week

Once again, we have two quotes for the price of one:

> I love Rust because it reduces bugs by targeting it’s biggest source… me.

– [ObliviousJD on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ObliviousJD/status/1094456407376637952)

> Say the same thing about seatbelts in a car. If you don’t plan to have accidents, why do you need seatbelts?
>
> Car accidents, like mistakes in programming are a risk that has a likelihood that is non-zero. A seatbelt might be a little bit annoying when things go well, but much less so when they don’t. Rust is there to stop you in most cases when you try to accidentally shot yourself into the leg, unless you deliberately without knowing what you are doing while yelling “hold my beer” (unsafe). And contrary to popular belief even in unsafe blocks many of Rust’s safety guarantees hold, just not all.
>
> …
>
> Just like with the seatbelt, there will be always those that don’t wear one for their very subjective reasons (e.g. because of edge cases where a seatbelt could trap you in a burning car, or because it is not cool, or because they hate the feeling and think accidents only happen to people who can’t drive).
