# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [safe](https://github.com/Centril/rust-safe), a `#[safe]` attribute for explaining why `unsafe { ... }` is OK. Thanks to [Michael-F-Bryan](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/569) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
