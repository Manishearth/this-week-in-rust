# Quote of the Week

> When picking up a lentil (Result) a pigeon (?) must consider two options. If the lentil is a good one (Ok), the pigeon simply puts it into the pot (evaluates to the wrapped value). However, if the lentil happens to be a bad one (Err), the pigeon eats it, digests it (from) and finally âreturnsâ it. Also the silhouette of a pigeon kind of resembles a questionmark.
