# Quote of the Week

> In many cases, it is possible to completely rearchitect the underlying code while leaving the public API as-is, and without introducing new bugs. I've literally never had such a liberating experience with refactoring until Rust.
>
> In other words, I have never been so productive in any other language. Dynamic languages like JavaScript and Python are the least productive *by far*. Code runs, tests pass, put it into production and... uncaught exception! Time to rollback and redo that whole dance **AGAIN**. With Rust, we take care of all of that crap while actually writing the code the first time. No more surprise 3am wake up calls. *That* is productivity.
