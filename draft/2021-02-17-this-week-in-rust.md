# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [threadIO](https://crates.io/crates/thread_io), a crate that makes disk IO in a background thread easy and elegant.

Thanks to [David Andersen](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/881) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Quote of the Week

> The main theme of Rust *is not* systems programming, speed, or memory safety - it's moving runtime problems to compile time. Everything else is incidental. This is an invaluable quality of any language, and is something Rust greatly excels at.
