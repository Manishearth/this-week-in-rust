Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

There is no *This Week in Rust* podcast this week, next week's episode will cover both this week and next week.
