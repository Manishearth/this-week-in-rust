## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-11-03](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-03.md):
0 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 0 mixed

A number of improvements on various benchmarks. The most notable news this week
in compiler performance is the progress on instruction metric collection on a
per-query level; see [measureme#143](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/143) for the latest.

Otherwise, this week was an excellent one for performance (though mostly on
stress tests and auto-generated test cases rather than commonly seen code).

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-03.md) for more.

# Quote of the Week

> Like other languages Rust does have footguns. The difference is that we keep ours locked up in the unsafe.
