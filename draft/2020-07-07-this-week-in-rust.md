# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [print_bytes](https://crates.io/crates/print_bytes), a library to print arbitrary bytes to a stream as losslessly as possible.

Thanks to [dylni](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/784) for the suggestion!

# Quote of the Week

> References are a sharp tool and there are roughly three different approaches to sharp tools.
>
> 1. Don't give programmers sharp tools. They may make mistakes and cut their fingers off. *This is the Java/Python/Perl/Ruby/PHP... approach.*
> 2. Give programmers all the sharp tools they want. They are professionals and if they cut their fingers off it's their own fault. *This is the C/C++ approach.*
> 3. Give programmers sharp tools, but put guards on them so they can't accidentally cut their fingers off. *This is Rust's approach.*
>
> Lifetime annotations are a safety guard on references. Rust's references have no sychronization and no reference counting -- that's what makes them sharp. References in category-1 languages (which typically *do* have synchronization and reference counting) are "blunted": they're not really *quite* as effective as category-2 and -3 references, but they don't cut you, and they still work; they might just slow you down a bit.
>
> So, frankly, I like lifetime annotations because they prevent me from cutting my fingers off.
