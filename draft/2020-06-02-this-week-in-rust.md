Title: This Week in Rust 341
Number: 341
Date: 2020-06-02
Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

# We Stand With You

Since our previous issue, there has been a lot of news about the civil
rights discourse in the United States, spawned by the killing of an innocent
member of the African American community. The Black Lives Matter movement has
gained a lot of traction in bringing to attention the social injustices that
haunt all people of color.

We believe that Rustaceans have a duty to our community and to the rest of
the world to ensure that people feel comfortable and welcome wherever they
may be. In our own community, the Rust Code of Conduct explicitly states that
we intend to make everybody feel safe, but this does not just apply to us.

Just as we support Rustaceans, we also support humanity as a whole. It is time
for social progress to be made. We support those risking their own well-being
to show support for marginalized people. We stand with the protesters hoping
to make the world better.

If you want to show your support,
[here is a website of curated resources](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/).
We encourage you to speak out, as one more voice is one step closer to a
better world.

# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-asm](https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm), a cargo subcommand to show the resulting assembly of a function. Useful for performance work.

Thanks to [Jay Oster](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/772) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
