## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-06-23](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020.md#2020-06-23). Lots of improvements this week, and no regressions, which is good. But we regularly see significant performance effects on rollups, which is a concern.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:
