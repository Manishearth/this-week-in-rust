## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-12-15](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-15.md):
6 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 2 Mixed

This week was fairly quite with lots of small regressions. Most of the regressions were either for fixes to changes that yielded large performance wins in previous weeks or small performance losses where there is already a plan for how to gain those losses back.

Triage done by @rylev.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-15.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs

are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:
