# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-intraconv](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-intraconv), a cargo subcommand to convert links in rust documentation to the newly stable intra-doc-links format.

Thanks to [Alexis Bourget](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/849) for the suggestion!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-11-24](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-24.md):
1 Regression, 2 Improvements, 2 mixed

This week saw landing of [#79237](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79237) which by itself provides no wins but opens the door to support for split debuginfo on macOS. This'll eventually show huge wins as we can likely avoid re-collecting debuginfo while retaining support for lldb and Rust backtraces. [#79361](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79361) tracks the stabilization of the rustc flag, but the precise rollout to stable users is not yet 100% clear.

Triage done by @jyn514 and @simulacrum.

4 regressions, 4 improvements, 2 mixed results.
5 of them in rollups.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-24.md) for more.
