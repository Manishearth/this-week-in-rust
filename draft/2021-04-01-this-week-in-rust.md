## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

An overall busy but decent week for performance. While there were some performance regressions they were mostly small, and they were outnumbered by performance gains. Perhaps the most interesting news is not a compiler performance improvement but rather the introduction of no-alias optimizations at the LLVM level. This slightly hurts optimized build time performance in some cases, but it should make some workloads run faster after compilation.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [f24ce9b0..9b6339e4](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=f24ce9b0140d9be5a336954e878d0c1522966bb8&end=9b6339e4b9747d473270baa42e77e1d2fff39bf4&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> Despite all the negative aspects, I must say that I do generally really like the poll-based approach that Rust is taking. Most of the problems encountered are encountered not because of mistakes, but because no other language really has pushed this principle this far. Programming language design is first and foremost an “artistic” activity, not a technical one, and anticipating the consequences of design choices is almost impossible.
