## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-01-12](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md):
1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 3 Mixed
Overall, a positive albeit quiet week. The largest change came from the incremental compilation working group which delivered large gains in performance caused by [changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76896) in how inlining is handled in debug mode. Unfortunately, these changes may be reversed due to concerns

Triage done by @rylev.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md) for more.

# Quote of the Week

> Why do I use the letter ‘o’ for my generic closure param name? [...] I recently realized that since Rust uses pipes to enclose a param block, using ‘o’ makes the block look like a TIE fighter. I am not a terribly serious person.
