# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [pre](https://github.com/aticu/pre), a library for declaring and checking the assurance of precondition, useful for unsafe functions.

Thanks to [Zicklag](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/792) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-07-21](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-07-21.md).
  A disastrous week. At least 7 regressions. 3 improvements. Lots of murkiness due to rollups.

## Approved RFCs
