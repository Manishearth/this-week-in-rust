## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1327: Dropck Eyepatch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1327). Refine the unguarded-escape-hatch from RFC 1238 (nonparametric dropck).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Default and expanded errors for rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1644).
* [Dedicated strike team to resolve unsafe code guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1643).
* [RFC process for formatting style and Rustfmt defaults](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1607).
* [Introduce more conventions around documenting Rust projects](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1574).
* [Allow all literals in attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1559).
* [Add `global_asm!` for module-level inline assembly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1548).
* [Exclude macros from importing with `#[macro_use(not(...))]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1517).
* [Add space-friendly arguments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1509). Add `-C link-arg` and `-C llvm-arg` which allow you to pass along argument with spaces.
* [Add support for 128-bit integers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1504).
* [Add a used attribute to prevent symbols from being discarded](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1459).
* [Add language support for bitfields](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1449).

## New RFCs

* [Add an `unwrap!` macro](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1669).
* [Semantic "private in public" enforcement](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1671). Enforce that public APIs do not expose private definitions at the semantic level, while allowing the use of private aliases and blanket implementations for convenience and automation.
* [Disjointness based on associated types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1672). During coherence checking, when determining if the receivers of two impls are disjoint, treat bounds with disjoint associated types as mutually exclusive bounds.
