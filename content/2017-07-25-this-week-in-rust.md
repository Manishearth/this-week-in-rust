# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cute](https://crates.io/crates/cute), a crate containing a macro to allow Python (or Haskell) style
comprehensions (e.g. `c![x / 2, for x in 0..10, if (x & 1) == 0]`). Thanks to [Willi Kappler](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/willi_kappler)
for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2044: Put the RFCs repo under license terms](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2044).
* [RFC 1946: Intra Rustdoc Links](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1946).
* [RFC 1861: Add `extern type` declarations for declaring types from external libraries which have an unknown size/layout](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1861).
* [Amend #1440: allow `const` items to contain drop types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1817).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] ["Guide-level" and "Reference-level" explanations to replace how we teach and detailed design sections](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2059).
* [disposition: merge] [Add replace and swap functions to RefCell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2057).
* [disposition: merge] [Generic associated types (associated type constructors)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598).
* [disposition: postpone] [Eager expansion of macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1628).
* [disposition: merge] [Allow an optional vert at the beginning of a match branch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1925).
* [disposition: merge] [Future-proofing enums/structs with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2008).

* [disposition: merge] [Tweak object safety rules to allow static dispatch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2027).

## New RFCs

* [stable mechanism to specify the behavior of panic! in no-std applications](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2070).
* [Add impl Trait type alias and variable declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2071).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

Currently being discussed:

* [Define short](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/47)
* [Special casing some macros](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/86)
