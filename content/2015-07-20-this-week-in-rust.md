Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us an

# What's cooking on nightly?

[bors](https://github.com/bors) underwent a [sudden unscheduled
upgrade](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/buildbot-is-down-for-a-bit/2365/4)
this week, incurring unusual ammounts of downtime. Thankfully, [Manish
crafted an epic rollup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27066)
to make up some of the slack.

98 pull requests were [merged in the last week][merged].

[merged]: https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Apr+org%3Arust-lang+is%3Amerged+merged%3A2015-07-13..2015-07-20

* [Implement `DerefMut` for
 `String`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26241)
* [Add specializations of read_to_end for Stdin and File using
  uninitialised buffers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26950)
* [Allow semi tokens after macro
  ty/path](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27000). See [the
  test
  case](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/blob/af556238ebe72d58adbcf339bd2fa0aef4e3caf9/src/test/run-pass/semi-after-macro-ty.rs)
  for an example of what this means.
* [LLVM was updated to
  3.7](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27076). Includes
  improved 32-bit MSVC, archive writing, and some performance
  improvements and minor fixes.

# Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC for creation of `IntoRaw{Fd, Socket, Handle}` trait to
  complement
  `AsRaw*`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1174). This
  provides interop between the standard library's I/O and other
  out-of-tree platform-specific APIs.

# Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a

# Quote of the Week

*Rust is very much about only paying for what you need, and often you don't need much, but when you do need something, Rust is more than ready to rummage in your wallet for loose change.* — [Manish Goregaokar](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3cj69b/why_go_and_rust_are_competitors/csw5t5v)
