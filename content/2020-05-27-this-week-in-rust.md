# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-asm](https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm), a cargo subcommand to show the resulting assembly of a function. Useful for performance work.

Thanks to [Trevor Spiteri](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/769) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
