## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-09-15](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-09-15.md):
  0 regressions, 2 improvements.

A few small compile-time regressions this week. The first was
[#70793](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70793), which added some
specializations to the standard library in order to increase runtime
performance. The second was
[#73996](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73996), which adds an option to
the diagnostics code to print only the names of types and traits when they are
unique instead of the whole path. The third was
[#75200](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75200), which refactored part
of `BTreeMap` to avoid aliasing mutable references.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [eRFC: Add JSON backend to Rustdoc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2963)

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

# Quote of the Week

> When you have a lifetime `<'a>` on a struct, that lifetime denotes references to values stored *outside* of the struct. If you try to store a reference that points inside the struct rather than outside, you will run into a compiler error when the compiler notices you **lied** to it.
