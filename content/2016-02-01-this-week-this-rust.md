# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [herbie-lint](https://crates.io/crates/herbie-lint), a miraculous compiler plugin to check the numerical stability of floating-point operations in the code. Another reason to have a nightly Rust handy.

Thanks to redditor [protestor](https://www.reddit.com/user/protestor) for the suggestion.
