# Crate of the Week

This week's crates is [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers), a Rust crate with python & nodejs bindings for fast text tokenization for machine learning.

llogiq (who singlehandedly selected the crate) is pretty self-congratulatory.

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
