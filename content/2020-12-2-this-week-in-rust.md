# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [kira](https://github.com/tesselode/kira), a library for expressive game audio with many bells and whistles (pardon the pun).

Thanks to [Alexis Bourget](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/849) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-11-24](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-24.md):
1 Regression, 2 Improvements, 2 mixed

This week saw landing of [#79237](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79237) which by itself provides no wins but opens the door to support for split debuginfo on macOS. This'll eventually show huge wins as we can likely avoid re-collecting debuginfo while retaining support for lldb and Rust backtraces. [#79361](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79361) tracks the stabilization of the rustc flag, but the precise rollout to stable users is not yet 100% clear.

Triage done by @jyn514 and @simulacrum.

4 regressions, 4 improvements, 2 mixed results.
5 of them in rollups.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-24.md) for more.

# Quote of the Week

> Let‚Äôs be clear: We understand that we are net beneficiaries of the exceptional work that others have done to make Rust thrive. AWS didn‚Äôt start Rust or make it the success that it is today, but we‚Äôd like to contribute to its future success.
