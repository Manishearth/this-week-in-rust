# Friend of the Tree

The Rust Team likes to occassionally recognize people who have made
outstanding contributions to The Rust Project, its ecosystem, and its
community. These people are 'friends of the tree'.

This week's friend of the tree was ... Manish Goregaokar!

Manish started working on Servo as part of the GSoC program in 2014, where he implemented XMLHttpRequest. Since then he's become in integral part of the Servo team while finishing his university studies and organizing Rust community events. In 2015 he took an interest in bors' queue and started making rollup PRs to accelerate the integration process. Nursing the PR queue is the kind of time-consuming labor that creates friends of the tree like Manish, the rollup friend of the tree.
