## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-12-15](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-15.md):
6 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 2 Mixed

This week was fairly quite with lots of small regressions. Most of the regressions were either for fixes to changes that yielded large performance wins in previous weeks or small performance losses where there is already a plan for how to gain those losses back.

Triage done by @rylev.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-15.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Stabilize Cargo's new feature resolver](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2957)

# Quote of the Week

> It took me sometime to let go and embrace getting things working before optimizing. It was a major breakthrough on that journey when I realized that ALL my python variables are `Rc<RefCell<_>>` , so any chance I had to make a variable that was less complicated than that was already a big optimization. If 1/10 Rust variables had to be that complicated it would not feel good, but it would already be 90% better. So if 1/50 make the code ezere to read and maintain then do it!
